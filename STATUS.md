## 2026-09-20 — scaffold and the four frozen seams
DID: repo, architecture and the seams that are expensive to change later.
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** — the plan reshaped around a rate-limited teacher. The headline
  metric is `unresolved/h`, not tokens/h. Labels come from outcomes, not authorship, so a
  wrong teacher call costs nothing. `situation_key` carries four jobs at once. The teacher
  writes artifacts before actions. The radio labels the vision heads.
- **`state_v1`** — 57 fields, tri-state throughout: unknown is never rendered as False.
- **JevRadio wire format** — 372 payload bits in 33 cells on a 12x4 grid (72x24 px at 6 px
  cells). 4 bits per channel, not 8: sixteen levels absorb gamma and capture transforms.
  Calibration row doubles as a locator, so the strip survives the window moving. Checksum
  and sequence counter answer different questions — misread vs hung addon.
- **`situation_key`** — teacher dedup, counterfactual join, agreement bucket and cache, one
  key. Versioned inside the key so changing bins invalidates the cache, not the corpus.
- **Episode store** — ticks / decisions / grades, JSONL on the hot path because a run
  normally ends in a crash and parquet buffers.
- **Verifier** — 7 named rules. A refusal is never a reason to stop.
- 108 tests, ruff clean. Nothing needs the game to run.

Decisions: `DECISIONS.md` V1–V13. The significant one is **V5** — the GuideGraph is
*generated from this server's own world DB* (6,599 quests, 109,358 spawns with exact
coordinates), then verified by walking. The recorder pass shrinks to routes and hazards,
which is all the DB cannot answer.

NOW: the scaffold is complete and the seams are frozen. Nothing drives the game yet.

NEXT, in order:
1. `guide/generate.py` — emit the 1–12 spine from the world DB, one zone, with `on_fail`
   edges. This is now a query, not a walk.
2. `JevRadio.lua` — the painter, against the generated `Fields.lua`.
3. `radio_frame.py` — locate the strip from its markers, sample cells, decode.
4. The scripted GOAP coach, so the zero-teacher-call invariant becomes enforceable.
5. First vertical slice: accept a quest, kill ten mobs, turn it in, fully recorded.

Open: **V7**, the multi-client input path. Not blocking until Gate B.
